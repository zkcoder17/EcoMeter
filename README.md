# EcoMeter
Evaluating Website Sustainability, One Click at a Time
# Technology Utilized
Our team employed standard HTML and JavaScript with a few APIs to build EcoMeter. To determine whether if the web host provider for the given website was green or not, we used the Greencheck API, which returns the ecological state of the web host for a given domain. From the same Green Web Foundation API, we deployed the IP to CO2 API to determine the CO2 intensity from a given IP address. Consequently, we determined the IP address by making calls to the Google DNS. Finally, our Chrome extension had native integration with Ecosia Web Browser, for more green browsing.
